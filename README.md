# Codewars Checker

This repository provides a simple script to retrieve the latest Codewars challenge solved by each user listed in a text file.

## Usage

1. Create a text file (e.g., `users.txt`) containing one Codewars username per line.
2. Run the script and pass the file path as an argument:

```bash
python3 get_latest_challenges.py users.txt
```

The script will output the most recent completed challenge for each user.
